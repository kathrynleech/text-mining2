The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies text mining to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a text mining study that visualize text data.**

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   Reich, J., Tingley, D. H., Leder-Luis, J., Roberts, M., & Stewart, B. M. (2014). Computer-assisted reading and discovery for student generated text in massive open online courses.

2.  How does the visualization address research questions?

    -   Figure 2 (Right Panel) (p. 165) presents the results of a topic modeling analysis showing that that participants of different ages wrote about different topics. Specifically, younger participants used words that belonged to the "elite association" category than "professional development" topics.  

Draft a research question for a population you may be interested in studying, or that would be of interest to educational researchers, and that would require the collection of text data and answer the following questions:

1.  What text data would need to be collected?

    -   Transcripts of parent-child conversations while interacting within informal science contexts. 

2.  For what reason would text data need to be collected in order to address this question?

    -   The text data would allow for a topic modeling analysis to determine what topics are discussed by parents and their children within this context.

3.  Explain the analytical level at which these text data would need to be collected and analyzed.

    -   Data would need to be collected, transcribed, converted to a .csv file, tokenized. From there, a document matrix can be created and a structural topic model could be run on the document matrix. 
### Part II: Data Product

Use your case study file to create a new word cloud that does not include words that would give you important information about teachers' experiences with professional development. (For example, we did not include "University" in the word cloud describing where scholar came from as it occurs everywhere).

I highly recommend creating a new R script in your lab-1 folder to complete this task. When your code is ready to share, use the code chunk below to share the final code for your model and answer the questions that follow.

```{r, my-data-product}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud2)

opd_survey <- read_csv("data/opd_survey.csv")
opd_survey
glimpse(opd_survey)

#Clean dataset
opd_survey$Resource <- opd_survey$Resource...6
opd_teacher <- opd_survey %>%
  select(Role, Resource, Q21) %>%
  rename(text = Q21) %>%
  slice(-1, -2) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  filter(Role == "Teacher")

head(opd_teacher)

```
```{r}
#Tokenize dataset
opd_tidy <- unnest_tokens(opd_teacher, word, text)
head(opd_tidy)

#Remove stopwords
head(stop_words)
view(stop_words)

opd_clean <- anti_join(opd_tidy, stop_words)
head(opd_clean)

```

```{r}
#Wordcloud
opd_counts <- count(opd_clean, word, sort = TRUE)
opd_counts <- opd_clean %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
opd_counts

#remove words that give us important information about teachers’ experiences with professional development
exclude_words <-data.frame("word"= c("examples", "videos"))
opd_excluded <- anti_join(opd_clean, exclude_words) 

#create wordcloud
opd_counts2 <-opd_excluded %>%
  count(word,sort=TRUE)
head(opd_counts2)

wordcloud2(opd_counts2)

```

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Intro to text mining Badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review:

1.  Change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):

    -   Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account.

    -   Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [Text mining Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis/discussions/3). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
